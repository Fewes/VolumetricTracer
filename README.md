# VolumetricTracer
A simple way to render soft, volumetric bullet tracers in Unity. Only needs a unit cube and a material to render and supports instancing, soft scene blending and camera intersection.

# Usage
See the VolumetricTracer prefab for an example on how to use it. To control the size of the tracer, just change the scale of the GameObject.
